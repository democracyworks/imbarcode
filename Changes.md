## Changes between 0.1.6 and 1.0.0

* Project renamed from `turbovote.imbarcode` to `democracyworks/imbarcode`
    * This moved all of the files, directories, and namespaces around
    * **This is a breaking change**
* Ported from cljx to reader conditionals (cljc)
* ClojureScript tests ported from `com.cemerick/clojurescript.test` to `cljs.test`

## Changes prior to 0.1.6

Changes.md was added at version 1.0.0 so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
